    Support has been re-added for the MySQL-Connector/Python DBAPI using the
    ``mysql+mysqlconnector://`` URL scheme.   The DBAPI now works against
    modern MySQL versions as well as MariaDB versions (in the latter case it's
    required to pass charset/collation explicitly).   Note however that
    server side cursor support is disabled due to unresolved issues with this
    driver.
