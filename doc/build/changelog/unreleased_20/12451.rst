    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`7471` leading to a SQL compilation
    issue where name disambiguation for two same-named FROM clauses with table
    aliasing in use at the same time would produce invalid SQL in the FROM
    clause with two "AS" clauses for the aliased table, due to double aliasing.
