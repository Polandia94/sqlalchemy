    Expanded the rules for when to apply parenthesis to a server default in DDL
    to suit the general case of a default string that contains non-word
    characters such as spaces or operators and is not a string literal.

    Fixed issue in MySQL server default reflection where a default that has
    spaces would not be correctly reflected.  Additionally, expanded the rules
    for when to apply parenthesis to a server default in DDL to suit the
    general case of a default string that contains non-word characters such as
    spaces or operators and is not a string literal.
