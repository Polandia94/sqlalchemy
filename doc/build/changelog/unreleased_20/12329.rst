    Fixed regression which occurred as of 2.0.37 where the checked
    :class:`.ArgumentError` that's raised when an inappropriate type or object
    is used inside of a :class:`.Mapped` annotation would raise ``TypeError``
    with "boolean value of this clause is not defined" if the object resolved
    into a SQL expression in a boolean context, for programs where future
    annotations mode was not enabled.  This case is now handled explicitly and
    a new error message has also been tailored for this case.  In addition, as
    there are at least half a dozen distinct error scenarios for intepretation
    of the :class:`.Mapped` construct, these scenarios have all been unified
    under a new subclass of :class:`.ArgumentError` called
    :class:`.MappedAnnotationError`, to provide some continuity between these
    different scenarios, even though specific messaging remains distinct.
