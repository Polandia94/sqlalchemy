    Fixed issue regarding ``Union`` types that would be present in the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map` of a :class:`_orm.registry`
    or declarative base class, where a ``Mapped[]`` element that included one
    of the subtypes present in that ``Union`` would be matched to that entry,
    potentially ignoring other entries that matched exactly.   The correct
    behavior now takes place such that an entry should only match in
    ``type_annotation_map`` exactly, as a ``Union`` type is a self-contained
    type. For example, an attribute with ``Mapped[float]`` would previously
    match to a ``type_annotation_map`` entry ``Union[float, Decimal]``; this
    will no longer match and will now only match to an entry that states
    ``float``. Pull request courtesy Frazer McLean.
