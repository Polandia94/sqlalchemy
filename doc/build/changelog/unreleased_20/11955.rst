    Consistently handle ``TypeAliasType`` (defined in PEP 695) obtained with the
    ``type X = int`` syntax introduced in python 3.12.
    Now in all cases one such alias must be explicitly added to the type map for
    it to be usable inside ``Mapped[]``.
    This change also revises the approach added in :ticket:`11305`, now requiring
    the ``TypeAliasType`` to be added to the type map.
    Documentation on how unions and type alias types are handled by SQLAlchemy
    has been added in the :ref:`orm_declarative_mapped_column_type_map` section
    of the documentation.
